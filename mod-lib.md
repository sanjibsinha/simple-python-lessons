Build a small application that utilizes the concepts learned today, such as a simple date and time utility or a basic calculator using the math module.
Let's start by explaining modules and libraries.

===========

Today, we're diving into **Modules and Libraries** in Python. These are fundamental building blocks that will significantly expand what you can do with your code. 
Think of them as toolboxes filled with pre-written code that you can use in your own programs.

Let's break down today's topics step by step with explanations and examples, and then we'll build a small application to solidify your understanding.

### **What are Modules and Libraries?**

In Python, **modules** and **libraries** are essentially collections of code that provide functionalities beyond the basic language features. They help you organize your code and reuse code written by others.

*   **Module**: A module is simply a file containing Python definitions and statements. These definitions can be functions, classes, or variables. Think of a module as a single toolbox containing related tools.
*   **Library**: A library is a collection of related modules. It's like a set of toolboxes, where each toolbox (module) contains tools for a specific purpose, and the entire set (library) is for a broader category of tasks. Sometimes, the terms "library" and "module" are used interchangeably, especially when referring to single-module libraries.

Python has a rich set of built-in libraries and also supports external, third-party libraries that you can add to your projects.

### **1. Using Python's Built-in Libraries**

Python comes with a standard library that includes a vast collection of modules for various tasks. Let's explore two commonly used built-in libraries: `math` and `datetime`.

#### **a) `math` Module**

The `math` module provides access to mathematical functions.

**Example:** Let's say you want to calculate the square root of a number or use trigonometric functions.

```python
import math

# Calculate square root of 16
square_root = math.sqrt(16)
print(f"The square root of 16 is: {square_root}")

# Calculate sine of 90 degrees (in radians)
sine_value = math.sin(math.radians(90)) # Convert 90 degrees to radians first
print(f"The sine of 90 degrees is: {sine_value}")

# Constants like pi
pi_value = math.pi
print(f"The value of pi is: {pi_value}")
```

**Explanation:**

*   `import math`: This line imports the entire `math` module, making all its functions and constants available in your script.
*   `math.sqrt(16)`: This calls the `sqrt()` function from the `math` module to calculate the square root of 16.
*   `math.sin(math.radians(90))`: This demonstrates using nested functions. `math.radians(90)` converts 90 degrees to radians (as trigonometric functions in `math` work with radians), and then `math.sin()` calculates the sine.
*   `math.pi`: This is a constant defined in the `math` module representing the value of pi.

**Key Takeaways from `math` Module:**

*   Provides a wide range of mathematical functions (trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, etc.).
*   Includes mathematical constants like `pi` and `e`.
*   To use it, you first need to `import math`. Then you can access functions and constants using the dot (`.`) notation (e.g., `math.function_name`).

#### **b) `datetime` Module**

The `datetime` module supplies classes for working with dates and times.

**Example:** Let's say you want to get the current date and time, or perform operations on dates.

```python
import datetime

# Get current date and time
current_datetime = datetime.datetime.now()
print(f"Current date and time: {current_datetime}")

# Get current date
current_date = datetime.date.today()
print(f"Current date: {current_date}")

# Get current time
current_time = datetime.datetime.now().time()
print(f"Current time: {current_time}")

# Create a specific date
specific_date = datetime.date(2025, 3, 15) # Year, month, day
print(f"Specific date: {specific_date}")

# Perform date arithmetic (e.g., find date after 10 days)
time_delta = datetime.timedelta(days=10)
future_date = current_date + time_delta
print(f"Date after 10 days from today: {future_date}")
```

**Explanation:**

*   `import datetime`: Imports the `datetime` module.
*   `datetime.datetime.now()`:  `datetime` module contains classes like `date`, `time`, `datetime`, and `timedelta`. Here, `datetime.datetime` is a class within the `datetime` module, and `now()` is a method to get the current date and time.
*   `datetime.date.today()`:  `datetime.date` is a class for dates, and `today()` is a method to get the current date.
*   `datetime.datetime.now().time()`:  Shows how you can chain methods. First, get the current datetime, then use `.time()` to extract only the time part.
*   `datetime.date(2025, 3, 15)`:  Shows how to create a date object for a specific date (March 15, 2025).
*   `datetime.timedelta(days=10)`: `timedelta` is used for durations, here representing 10 days. You can perform arithmetic operations on dates using `timedelta`.

**Key Takeaways from `datetime` Module:**

*   Provides classes to work with dates, times, and time intervals.
*   Useful for tasks like date calculations, formatting dates, and time tracking.
*   Like `math`, you first `import datetime` and then use its classes and methods.

### **2. Creating and Using Your Own Modules**

As you start building projects, you'll want to organize your code into modules. This makes your code more manageable and reusable. Let's create a simple module and use it.

**Step 1: Create a Python file (your module)**

Let's create a file named `my_module.py`. This file will be our module. Inside it, let's define a function and a variable:

```python
# my_module.py

def greet(name):
    """This function greets the person passed in as a parameter."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python modules.")

module_name = "My First Module"
```

**Step 2: Use your module in another Python script**

Now, let's create another Python file, say `main_script.py`, in the same directory as `my_module.py`. In `main_script.py`, we will use the module we just created.

```python
# main_script.py

import my_module

# Use the function from my_module
my_module.greet("User")

# Access a variable from my_module
print(f"Module name: {my_module.module_name}")
```

**Explanation:**

*   `import my_module`: This line imports the module we created. Python looks for `my_module.py` in the same directory, and in directories specified in the Python path.
*   `my_module.greet("User")`: Calls the `greet` function defined in `my_module.py`, passing "User" as an argument.
*   `my_module.module_name`: Accesses the variable `module_name` defined in `my_module.py`.

**To run this:**

1.  Make sure both `my_module.py` and `main_script.py` are in the same directory.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to that directory, and run `python main_script.py`.

You should see the output:

```
Hello, User! Welcome to Python modules.
Module name: My First Module
```

**Key Takeaways from Creating Modules:**

*   Any Python file can be a module.
*   Use `import module_name` to import a module.
*   Access functions, classes, and variables within a module using `module_name.item_name`.
*   Modules help in organizing code and promoting reusability.

### **3. Installing and Using Third-Party Libraries with `pip`**

Python's ecosystem is incredibly rich because of its vast collection of third-party libraries. These libraries are created by the community and are available for almost any task you can imagine. `pip` is the package installer for Python, used to install and manage these third-party libraries.

#### **a) Installing a Library using `pip`**

Let's install a popular library called `requests`. This library is used for making HTTP requests, which is essential for tasks like fetching data from websites.

**Steps to install `requests`:**

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

    `pip` will download and install the `requests` library and any dependencies it needs. Once the installation is complete, you can use `requests` in your Python scripts.

#### **b) Using the `requests` Library**

Let's use `requests` to fetch content from a website.

```python
import requests

# Make a request to a website
response = requests.get("https://www.example.com")

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Request was successful!")
    # Print the first 500 characters of the website's content
    print("First 500 characters of content:")
    print(response.text[:500])
else:
    print(f"Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
```

**Explanation:**

*   `import requests`: Imports the `requests` library.
*   `requests.get("https://www.example.com")`: Uses the `get()` function from the `requests` library to send an HTTP GET request to `https://www.example.com`. This fetches the content of the webpage.
*   `response.status_code`: The `response` object contains information about the server's response, including the status code. A status code of `200` generally means "OK" or success.
*   `response.text`: Contains the content of the response, usually in HTML format for webpages.
*   `response.text[:500]`:  Slices the text to print only the first 500 characters for brevity.

**To run this:**

1.  Make sure you have installed the `requests` library using `pip install requests`.
2.  Save the above code in a Python file (e.g., `request_example.py`).
3.  Run it from your terminal using `python request_example.py`.

You should see output indicating whether the request was successful and the first part of the website's content.

**Key Takeaways from Third-Party Libraries and `pip`:**

*   `pip` is used to install and manage third-party libraries.
*   Vast ecosystem of libraries available for almost any task.
*   Use `pip install library_name` in the terminal to install a library.
*   After installation, you can import and use these libraries in your Python code just like built-in modules.

### **Small Application: Date and Time Utility**

Let's build a simple application that uses the `datetime` module to perform some date and time operations. This application will:

1.  Display the current date and time.
2.  Allow the user to input a future date and calculate the number of days until that date.

```python
import datetime

def display_current_datetime():
    """Displays the current date and time."""
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    print("Current Date and Time:", now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) # Formatted output

def calculate_days_until_date():
    """Calculates days until a user-specified date."""
    year = int(input("Enter year (YYYY): "))
    month = int(input("Enter month (MM): "))
    day = int(input("Enter day (DD): "))

    future_date = datetime.date(year, month, day)
    today_date = datetime.date.today()

    if future_date < today_date:
        print("Future date cannot be in the past!")
    else:
        time_difference = future_date - today_date
        days_difference = time_difference.days
        print(f"Days until {future_date}: {days_difference} days")

def main():
    """Main function to run the date utility."""
    print("Welcome to the Date and Time Utility!")
    display_current_datetime()
    calculate_days_until_date()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation of the Application:**

*   **`display_current_datetime()`**: Gets the current date and time using `datetime.datetime.now()` and formats it into a readable string using `strftime()`.  `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"` is a format string (Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second).
*   **`calculate_days_until_date()`**:
    *   Prompts the user to input a year, month, and day for a future date.
    *   Creates `datetime.date` objects for both the future date and today's date.
    *   Calculates the difference between the future date and today's date, which results in a `datetime.timedelta` object.
    *   Extracts the number of days from the `timedelta` object using `.days`.
    *   Handles the case where the user enters a date in the past.
*   **`main()`**:  The main function to run the utility, calling the other functions in sequence.
*   **`if __name__ == "__main__":`**: This standard Python construct ensures that the `main()` function is called only when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module into another script).

**To run this application:**

1.  Save the code in a file named, for example, `date_utility.py`.
2.  Run it from your terminal using `python date_utility.py`.

The application will first display the current date and time, and then ask you to enter a future date to calculate the days until that date.
