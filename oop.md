=============

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

OOP is a programming paradigm centered around "objects." Think of objects as self-contained entities that have both data and behavior. In Python, OOP revolves around organizing your code using classes and objects, making it more modular, reusable, and easier to manage, especially for projects of small to medium size.

### 1. Understanding Classes and Objects

*   **Class:** A class is like a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that objects of that class will have. Imagine a cookie cutter â€“ the cookie cutter is the class.
*   **Object:** An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete entity created based on the class blueprint.  The cookies you make using the cookie cutter are the objects.

Let's take a simple example: Imagine you want to represent a `Dog` in your program.

```python
class Dog:
    pass
```

Here, `Dog` is a class. It's currently empty, but we've defined the blueprint for what a `Dog` object will be. Now, let's create objects (instances) of the `Dog` class:

```python
my_dog = Dog()
your_dog = Dog()
```

`my_dog` and `your_dog` are objects of the `Dog` class. They are distinct instances, just like two different dogs in the real world, even though they are both created from the same `Dog` blueprint.

### 2. Constructors (`__init__`), Methods, and Attributes

To make our `Dog` class more useful, we need to add characteristics (attributes) and actions (methods).

*   **Attributes:** Attributes are variables that hold data about the object. For a `Dog`, attributes could be its name, breed, and age.
*   **Methods:** Methods are functions that define what an object can do. For a `Dog`, methods could be `bark()`, `eat()`, and `sleep()`.
*   **Constructor (`__init__`)**: This is a special method that's automatically called when you create an object from a class. It's used to initialize the object's attributes.

Let's enhance our `Dog` class:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed, age):
        self.name = name  # Attribute: name
        self.breed = breed # Attribute: breed
        self.age = age   # Attribute: age

    def bark(self):      # Method: bark
        return "Woof!"

    def description(self): # Method: description
        return f"{self.name} is a {self.age}-year-old {self.breed}."
```

**Explanation:**

*   `__init__(self, name, breed, age)`: This is the constructor.
    *   `self` refers to the instance of the object itself. It's always the first parameter in methods within a class.
    *   `name`, `breed`, `age` are parameters to initialize the dog's attributes.
    *   `self.name = name` (and similar lines) assign the passed values to the object's attributes.
*   `bark(self)` and `description(self)`: These are methods that define actions a `Dog` object can perform.

Now, let's create and use `Dog` objects:

```python
buddy = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever", 3)
print(buddy.name)        # Output: Buddy
print(buddy.bark())        # Output: Woof!
print(buddy.description()) # Output: Buddy is a 3-year-old Golden Retriever.

lucy = Dog("Lucy", "Poodle", 5)
print(lucy.name)         # Output: Lucy
print(lucy.description())  # Output: Lucy is a 5-year-old Poodle.
```

### 3. Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation

These are the three pillars of OOP, making your code reusable, flexible, and secure.

*   **Inheritance:** Inheritance allows a class (child class or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class or superclass). This promotes code reuse. Imagine you have a `Animal` class, and you want to create `Dog` and `Cat` classes. Both `Dog` and `Cat` are animals, so they share common characteristics (like eating, sleeping). Inheritance lets you define these common traits in the `Animal` class and then reuse them in `Dog` and `Cat`, while also adding specific traits for each.

    Let's create a parent class `Animal` and a child class `Cat` that inherits from `Animal`:

    ```python
    class Animal: # Parent class
        def __init__(self, name, species):
            self.name = name
            self.species = species

        def make_sound(self):
            return "Generic animal sound"

        def description(self):
            return f"{self.name} is a {self.species}."

    class Cat(Animal): # Child class inheriting from Animal
        def __init__(self, name, breed, age):
            # Call the constructor of the parent class to initialize name and species
            super().__init__(name, species="Cat")
            self.breed = breed
            self.age = age

        def make_sound(self): # Method overriding
            return "Meow!"

        def description(self): # Method overriding
            return f"{self.name} is a {self.age}-year-old {self.breed} cat."
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    *   `class Cat(Animal):` indicates that `Cat` inherits from `Animal`.
    *   `super().__init__(name, species="Cat")` in `Cat`'s constructor calls the `__init__` method of the `Animal` class to initialize `name` and `species`. We set `species` to "Cat" here as all instances of `Cat` will be of the species "Cat".
    *   `make_sound(self)` and `description(self)` methods are *overridden* in the `Cat` class. This means `Cat` provides its own specific implementation of these methods, different from the `Animal` class.

    Using these classes:

    ```python
    animal = Animal("Generic Animal", "Unknown")
    print(animal.description())    # Output: Generic Animal is a Unknown.
    print(animal.make_sound())     # Output: Generic animal sound

    whiskers = Cat("Whiskers", "Siamese", 2)
    print(whiskers.description())  # Output: Whiskers is a 2-year-old Siamese cat.
    print(whiskers.make_sound())   # Output: Meow!
    ```

*   **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism (meaning "many forms") allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way.  In our example, both `Animal` and `Cat` have a `make_sound()` method, but they produce different sounds. This is polymorphism in action.

    ```python
    animals = [animal, whiskers] # List of different animal objects

    for pet in animals:
        print(pet.description())
        print(pet.make_sound()) # Polymorphic behavior - each object makes its sound
        print("---")
    ```

    **Output:**

    ```
    Generic Animal is a Unknown.
    Generic animal sound
    ---
    Whiskers is a 2-year-old Siamese cat.
    Meow!
    ---
    ```

*   **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (a class). It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components. In Python, encapsulation is achieved through conventions (like using single or double underscores to denote protected or private members), rather than strict access modifiers like in some other languages.

    Let's add an encapsulated attribute to our `Dog` class:

    ```python
    class Dog:
        def __init__(self, name, breed, age):
            self.name = name
            self.breed = breed
            self.age = age
            self._is_hungry = True # Encapsulated attribute (protected by convention)

        def bark(self):
            return "Woof!"

        def description(self):
            return f"{self.name} is a {self.age}-year-old {self.breed}."

        def feed(self):
            if self._is_hungry:
                self._is_hungry = False
                return f"{self.name} has been fed."
            else:
                return f"{self.name} is not hungry."

        def is_hungry(self): # Method to access the encapsulated attribute
            return self._is_hungry
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    *   `_is_hungry`: We've used a single underscore prefix (`_`) to indicate that `_is_hungry` is intended to be a protected attribute. By convention, this suggests that it should not be directly accessed or modified from outside the class.
    *   `feed(self)` and `is_hungry(self)`: These methods provide controlled ways to interact with the `_is_hungry` attribute.

    Using encapsulation:

    ```python
    dog = Dog("Max", "Labrador", 4)
    # print(dog._is_hungry) # Technically possible, but discouraged (by convention)
    print(dog.is_hungry())   # Output: True (Correct way to access)
    print(dog.feed())       # Output: Max has been fed.
    print(dog.is_hungry())   # Output: False
    print(dog.feed())       # Output: Max is not hungry.
    ```

### 4. Special Methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`)

Special methods, also known as magic methods or dunder methods (because they start and end with double underscores), add "magic" to your classes. They define how your objects behave in certain built-in operations or functions.

*   `__str__(self)`:  This method is called when you try to convert the object to a string (e.g., using `str(object)` or `print(object)`). It should return a user-friendly string representation of the object.
*   `__repr__(self)`: This method is called when you want a more unambiguous, developer-friendly string representation of the object. It's often used for debugging. If `__str__` is not defined, Python will use `__repr__` for string conversion as well.
*   `__len__(self)`: If you want your object to work with the `len()` function (like lists or strings), you can define `__len__(self)` to return the "length" of your object.

Let's add these special methods to our `Dog` class:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed, age, tricks):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.age = age
        self.tricks = tricks # Let's add a list of tricks
        self._is_hungry = True

    def bark(self):
        return "Woof!"

    def description(self):
        return f"{self.name} is a {self.age}-year-old {self.breed}."

    def feed(self):
        if self._is_hungry:
            self._is_hungry = False
            return f"{self.name} has been fed."
        else:
            return f"{self.name} is not hungry."

    def is_hungry(self):
        return self._is_hungry

    def __str__(self): # User-friendly string representation
        return f"Dog named {self.name}, breed: {self.breed}"

    def __repr__(self): # Developer-friendly representation
        return f"Dog(name='{self.name}', breed='{self.breed}', age={self.age}, tricks={self.tricks})"

    def __len__(self): # Define length as the number of tricks
        return len(self.tricks)
```

Using special methods:

```python
dog = Dog("Charlie", "Beagle", 2, ["sit", "fetch", "roll over"])

print(dog)          # Output: Dog named Charlie, breed: Beagle (Uses __str__)
print(str(dog))     # Output: Dog named Charlie, breed: Beagle (Explicitly calls __str__)
print(repr(dog))    # Output: Dog(name='Charlie', breed='Beagle', age=2, tricks=['sit', 'fetch', 'roll over']) (Uses __repr__)
print(len(dog))     # Output: 3 (Uses __len__)
```

### 5. Creating and Using Classes in Python

We've been creating and using classes throughout our examples. To summarize the process:

1.  **Define a class:** Use the `class` keyword followed by the class name (e.g., `class Dog:`).
2.  **Add a constructor (`__init__`)**: To initialize object attributes when objects are created.
3.  **Add methods**: To define the actions objects can perform. The first parameter of each method should be `self`.
4.  **Create objects (instances)**: Call the class name like a function, passing arguments for the constructor (e.g., `my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever", 3)`).
5.  **Access attributes and call methods**: Use dot notation (e.g., `my_dog.name`, `my_dog.bark()`).

## Small Application: Simple Library Management System

Let's build a very basic Library Management System using OOP concepts we've learned. We'll have two main entities: `Book` and `Library`.

**Classes:**

*   **`Book` Class:**
    *   Attributes: `title`, `author`, `isbn`, `is_available` (boolean, initially `True`)
    *   Methods:
        *   `__init__(self, title, author, isbn)`: Constructor to initialize book attributes.
        *   `__str__(self)`:  Returns a user-friendly string representation of the book.
        *   `borrow_book(self)`: Sets `is_available` to `False` if the book is available, returns a message.
        *   `return_book(self)`: Sets `is_available` to `True`, returns a message.

*   **`Library` Class:**
    *   Attributes: `name`, `books` (a list to hold `Book` objects)
    *   Methods:
        *   `__init__(self, name)`: Constructor to initialize library name and an empty list for books.
        *   `add_book(self, book)`: Adds a `Book` object to the `books` list.
        *   `find_book_by_isbn(self, isbn)`: Searches for a book by ISBN and returns the `Book` object if found, otherwise `None`.
        *   `display_available_books(self)`: Prints a list of available books in the library.
        *   `display_all_books(self)`: Prints a list of all books in the library.

**Code:**

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, isbn):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.isbn = isbn
        self.is_available = True

    def __str__(self):
        availability = "Available" if self.is_available else "Borrowed"
        return f"Title: {self.title}, Author: {self.author}, ISBN: {self.isbn} - Status: {availability}"

    def borrow_book(self):
        if self.is_available:
            self.is_available = False
            return f"Book '{self.title}' (ISBN: {self.isbn}) has been borrowed."
        else:
            return f"Book '{self.title}' (ISBN: {self.isbn}) is already borrowed."

    def return_book(self):
        if not self.is_available:
            self.is_available = True
            return f"Book '{self.title}' (ISBN: {self.isbn}) has been returned."
        else:
            return f"Book '{self.title}' (ISBN: {self.isbn}) is already available in the library."


class Library:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.books = []

    def add_book(self, book):
        if isinstance(book, Book): # Encapsulation: Ensuring only Book objects are added
            self.books.append(book)
            return f"Book '{book.title}' added to the library."
        else:
            return "Invalid input: Only Book objects can be added."

    def find_book_by_isbn(self, isbn):
        for book in self.books:
            if book.isbn == isbn:
                return book
        return None

    def display_available_books(self):
        available_books = [book for book in self.books if book.is_available]
        if available_books:
            print("\nAvailable Books:")
            for book in available_books:
                print(book)
        else:
            print("\nNo books are currently available.")

    def display_all_books(self):
        if self.books:
            print("\nAll Books in the Library:")
            for book in self.books:
                print(book)
        else:
            print("\nLibrary is empty.")
```

**Using the Library Management System:**

```python
# Create a Library
my_library = Library("City Central Library")

# Create Book objects
book1 = Book("The Lord of the Rings", "J.R.R. Tolkien", "978-0618260263")
book2 = Book("Pride and Prejudice", "Jane Austen", "978-0141439518")
book3 = Book("1984", "George Orwell", "978-0451524935")

# Add books to the library
print(my_library.add_book(book1)) # Output: Book 'The Lord of the Rings' added to the library.
print(my_library.add_book(book2)) # Output: Book 'Pride and Prejudice' added to the library.
print(my_library.add_book(book3)) # Output: Book '1984' added to the library.

# Display available books
my_library.display_available_books()
# Output:
# Available Books:
# Title: The Lord of the Rings, Author: J.R.R. Tolkien, ISBN: 978-0618260263 - Status: Available
# Title: Pride and Prejudice, Author: Jane Austen, ISBN: 978-0141439518 - Status: Available
# Title: 1984, Author: George Orwell, ISBN: 978-0451524935 - Status: Available

# Borrow a book
book_to_borrow = my_library.find_book_by_isbn("978-0618260263")
if book_to_borrow:
    print(book_to_borrow.borrow_book()) # Output: Book 'The Lord of the Rings' (ISBN: 978-0618260263) has been borrowed.
else:
    print("Book not found.")

# Display available books again
my_library.display_available_books()
# Output:
# Available Books:
# Title: Pride and Prejudice, Author: Jane Austen, ISBN: 978-0141439518 - Status: Available
# Title: 1984, Author: George Orwell, ISBN: 978-0451524935 - Status: Available

# Return a book
book_to_return = my_library.find_book_by_isbn("978-0618260263")
if book_to_return:
    print(book_to_return.return_book()) # Output: Book 'The Lord of the Rings' (ISBN: 978-0618260263) has been returned.
else:
    print("Book not found.")

# Display all books to see the updated status
my_library.display_all_books()
# Output:
# All Books in the Library:
# Title: The Lord of the Rings, Author: J.R.R. Tolkien, ISBN: 978-0618260263 - Status: Available
# Title: Pride and Prejudice, Author: Jane Austen, ISBN: 978-0141439518 - Status: Available
# Title: 1984, Author: George Orwell, ISBN: 978-0451524935 - Status: Available
```

This simple Library Management System demonstrates the core OOP concepts:

*   **Classes and Objects:** `Book` and `Library` are classes, and `book1`, `my_library` etc., are objects.
*   **Attributes and Methods:**  Each class has its own attributes and methods to manage its data and behavior.
*   **Encapsulation:** The `Library` class's `add_book` method checks if the input is a `Book` object, demonstrating a form of encapsulation by controlling the type of data it works with.
*   **Special Methods:**  The `__str__` method in the `Book` class provides a user-friendly string representation when you print a `Book` object.

This is just the beginning! OOP is a vast topic, but understanding these core concepts is crucial for building more complex and organized Python applications. In our next lessons, we can expand on these concepts and build more sophisticated applications. Let me know if you have any questions, or if you'd like to explore any of these concepts in more detail!
